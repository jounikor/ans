NOTE! Testing has been minimal so there MAY BE bugs around.

Visit my blog about these ANS experiments:

The three following Python3 programs implement my ANS ancoders/decoders. These
are simple and should be very readable, since they were implemented for my
ANS concept self-learning purposes.

  rans.py - An example implementation of rANS encoder and decoder.
  tans.py - An example implementation of tANS encoder and decoder.
  rabs.py - An example implementation of a binary alphabet rANS
            encoder and decoder with a simple adaptive propability model.
			The encoder allows 1 to 8 bits input/output during state
			renormalization.

The following C++ (v11 should be enough) program implements tANS encoder
and decoder template classes. These classes are purposely designed to mimic
low spec target platforms - read 8-bit systems.

  tans.cpp - An example driver program for encoding/decoding.
  ans.h            - The base class for encoder/decoder template classes.
  tans_encoder.h   - tANS encoder template class.
  tans_decoder.h   - tANS decoder templets class that does NOT use k-table.
  tans_decoder_k.h - tANS decoder templete class that uses k-table.
  trace.h          - Some tracing macros.
  rice_encoder.h   - Both Rice-Golomb and plain Rice encoder templates that
                     I have used to encode tANS symbol frequencies into the
					 output file. 

The following Z80 assembly file implements a tANS decoder and a required
function for building L- and Y-value decoding tables. The implementation 
currently is 84 bytes, excluding L- and Y-tables.

  z80_tans_decoder.asm

The following z80 assembly file implements a rABS decoder and a simple
dynamic model for propabilities. The implementation currently is 88
bytes, and nood for additional tables (due to simple context model).

  z80_rabs_decoder.asm

There's also a byte-wise version of rABS Z80 decoder. This is smaller
and faster than basic 1-bit at time decoder.
